                <p>Boston: We're simplifying our recycling stream to focus exclusively on bottles and cans to maximize our impact.</p>
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Did you know…?</p>
                <p>A single incorrect item can cause an entire bag to be discarded as waste rather than recycled. By carefully sorting our recyclables, we can help ensure that more materials are properly recycled.</p>
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why bottles and cans?</p>
                <p>Aluminum cans are one of the most recyclable items out there. In fact, a recycled aluminum can could be back on a store shelf as a brand-new can in as little as 60 days!</p>
                
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Have questions about why we’re making this change? </p>
                <p>Save them for the experts! We’re thrilled to invite you to an upcoming presentation where we’ll be joined by a sustainability expert and dive into where our recycling actually goes, share tips to reduce, reuse, and recycle effectively, and discuss how small changes can make a big difference. This will be a great chance to learn more and ask any questions about the research behind our program. Keep an eye out for the invite!
                </p>

                <p>Thank you for being a part of this important step in our sustainability journey. Together, we can make an impact, and we can’t wait to continue building these efforts with you.</p>
