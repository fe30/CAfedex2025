                <h3>Welcome to 950 N. Glebe</h3>
                <p>Hello Arlington!</p>
                <p>We are so excited to welcome you to 950 N. Glebe tomorrow and to start enjoying our new space and all the collaboration, innovation, and social connection it is sure to bring. 
                As a quick reminder, new badges can be picked up in the 2nd floor elevator bank during for the next few weeks. And don’t forget to return your badge for 4100 Fairfax – we’ll take care of recycling that for you!</p>
                <p>As you begin to make and capture new memories in this space, use <a href="#">THIS</a> gallery to share your photos with the firm. Whether it’s a photo of your favorite part of the new office or a snap of you and your colleagues enjoying a break in one of our many new common spaces, we want to see it!</p>
                <p>The Workplace Operations and IT teams worked hard to ensure your first experiences in our new office were as successful as possible. 
                However, with vendor delays and inclement weather in recent weeks, we still have work to do on a handful of non-move-in-critical items - including locker availability - on our punch lists. 
                In the spirit of being as transparent as possible, you can review our task list, including progress and expected resolution timetables (when available), <a href="#">HERE</a>. Of course, if you see anything in the office that needs urgent attention, don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly. </p>
                <p>Finally, moving forward, we will provide updates on an “as needed” basis when we have something specific or critical to share. In the meantime, you can always access our FAQs, our Good Day Glebe or Arlington office pages on CA Home, or reach out to the Workplace Operations team for any questions not answered in the previously listed resources. </p>
                <p>A huge thank you to everyone involved in this move, and to our entire Arlington community for your patience, flexibility, and support. We are thrilled to be in a space that truly reflects our firm, our values, and will help enhance the work we do for our clients and with each other. Be on the lookout soon for a calendar invite for our official office-warming celebration in the coming weeks!</p>
                <p>Thanks</p>
